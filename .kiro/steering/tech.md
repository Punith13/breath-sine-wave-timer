# Technology Stack

## Core Technologies

- **React 19.1.0** - UI framework with hooks-based architecture
- **TypeScript 5.8.3** - Type-safe JavaScript with strict typing
- **Vite 7.0.4** - Fast build tool and dev server with HMR
- **ESLint 9.30.1** - Code linting with TypeScript and React rules

## Build System

- **Vite** as the primary build tool and development server
- **TypeScript compiler** for type checking and compilation
- **ESLint** for code quality and style enforcement

## Development Dependencies

- `@vitejs/plugin-react` - React support for Vite
- `typescript-eslint` - TypeScript-specific ESLint rules
- `eslint-plugin-react-hooks` - React Hooks linting rules
- `eslint-plugin-react-refresh` - React Fast Refresh support

## Common Commands

```bash
# Development server with hot reload
npm run dev

# Production build (TypeScript compilation + Vite build)
npm run build

# Code linting
npm run lint

# Preview production build locally
npm run preview
```

## Code Style

- Uses modern React patterns with functional components and hooks
- TypeScript with strict type checking enabled
- ESLint configuration includes React Hooks rules and React Refresh
- Canvas API for graphics rendering
- CSS with system fonts and responsive design principles
