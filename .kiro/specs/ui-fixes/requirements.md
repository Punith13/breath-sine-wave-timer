# Requirements Document

## Introduction

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

4. WHEN the controls are visible AND the user clicks the toggle button THEN the controls SHALL become hidden

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user with light mode preferences, I want the slider tracks to have proper contrast against the light background, so that I can clearly see and interact with the sliders.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN the system is in dark mode THEN the slider tracks SHALL use light colors for proper contrast
3. WHEN hovering over sliders THEN the track colors SHALL provide visual feedback with appropriate contrast
4. WHEN the sliders are active THEN the track colors SHALL maintain accessibility contrast ratios

### Requirement 3
