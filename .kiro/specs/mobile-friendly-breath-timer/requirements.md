# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will transform the existing Breath Timer Sine Wave application into a mobile-friendly experience. The current application uses a fixed-size canvas (800x300px) and desktop-oriented controls that don't work well on mobile devices. This enhancement will make the application fully responsive, touch-friendly, and optimized for various screen sizes while maintaining the core breathing visualization functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want the breath timer to automatically adapt to my device's screen size, so that I can use the breathing exercise on any device without horizontal scrolling or content being cut off.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads on a mobile device THEN the canvas SHALL automatically resize to fit the screen width with appropriate margins
2. WHEN the screen orientation changes THEN the canvas SHALL adjust its dimensions to maintain optimal visibility
3. WHEN viewed on screens smaller than 768px THEN the canvas width SHALL not exceed 95% of the viewport width
4. WHEN viewed on screens smaller than 480px THEN the canvas height SHALL be reduced proportionally to maintain aspect ratio

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want touch-friendly controls for adjusting amplitude and speed, so that I can easily modify the breathing pattern with my fingers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using touch devices THEN the range sliders SHALL have increased touch target sizes (minimum 44px height)
2. WHEN dragging sliders on mobile THEN the system SHALL provide haptic feedback if available
3. WHEN adjusting controls THEN the labels SHALL display current values prominently for easy reading
4. WHEN using the apply button THEN it SHALL be large enough for comfortable touch interaction (minimum 48px height)

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want the interface to work well in both portrait and landscape orientations, so that I can use the app comfortably regardless of how I hold my device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the device is in portrait mode THEN the controls SHALL be positioned below the canvas in a vertical layout
2. WHEN the device is in landscape mode THEN the layout SHALL optimize for horizontal space usage
3. WHEN orientation changes THEN the canvas SHALL maintain its animation state without interruption
4. WHEN in landscape mode on small screens THEN the canvas SHALL take priority with controls in a compact layout

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want the text and interactive elements to be appropriately sized for mobile viewing, so that I can read and interact with the app without strain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewed on mobile devices THEN all text SHALL be at least 16px to prevent zoom on iOS
2. WHEN using the app THEN touch targets SHALL meet accessibility guidelines (minimum 44x44px)
3. WHEN viewing labels and values THEN they SHALL have sufficient contrast and size for mobile readability
4. WHEN the app loads THEN it SHALL prevent unwanted zoom behavior on mobile browsers

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want the breathing visualization to remain smooth and performant on my device, so that the meditation experience isn't disrupted by lag or stuttering.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the animation runs on mobile devices THEN it SHALL maintain at least 30fps performance
2. WHEN the canvas resizes THEN the sine wave animation SHALL scale proportionally without distortion
3. WHEN device resources are limited THEN the app SHALL gracefully reduce animation complexity if needed
4. WHEN running on older mobile devices THEN the app SHALL still provide a usable experience

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want the app to handle mobile browser behaviors appropriately, so that I have a native-like experience without browser interface interference.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app loads THEN it SHALL include proper viewport meta tags to control mobile rendering
2. WHEN scrolling is not needed THEN the app SHALL prevent bounce scrolling on iOS
3. WHEN the app is used THEN it SHALL prevent text selection on interactive elements
4. WHEN viewed in mobile browsers THEN the app SHALL handle safe area insets for devices with notches or rounded corners
