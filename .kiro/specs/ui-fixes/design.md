# Design Document

## Overview

This design addresses three UI bugs in the Breath Timer application through targeted fixes to component state initialization, CSS color schemes, and layout alignment. The solutions maintain the existing architecture while improving user experience and accessibility.

## Architecture

The fixes will be implemented across three main areas:
- **Component State Management**: Modify initial state in the main App component
- **CSS Color System**: Enhance the existing CSS custom properties for better contrast
- **Layout System**: Adjust existing flexbox alignment in the controls section

No architectural changes are required as the fixes work within the current React hooks-based architecture and CSS custom properties system.

## Components and Interfaces

### App Component State Changes
- **Current**: `const [showControls, setShowControls] = useState(true);`
- **Updated**: `const [showControls, setShowControls] = useState(false);`

The component interface remains unchanged, only the initial state value is modified.

### MobileSlider CSS Enhancements
The existing CSS custom properties system will be enhanced:
- **Current**: Uses `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.15)` for track colors in both themes
- **Updated**: Uses theme-aware colors with proper contrast ratios

### Button Alignment Fix
The existing `.button-wrapper` class will be enhanced to ensure proper centering across all scenarios.

## Data Models

No data model changes are required. All fixes are presentational and do not affect:
- State management patterns
- Props interfaces
- Event handling logic
- Animation systems

## Error Handling

### CSS Fallbacks
- Maintain existing fallback colors for browsers that don't support CSS custom properties
- Ensure graceful degradation for older browsers
- Preserve existing media query fallbacks

### State Management
- No error handling changes needed as the state change is a simple boolean default
- Existing error boundaries remain effective

## Testing Strategy

### Visual Testing
1. **Theme Testing**: Verify slider contrast in both light and dark modes
2. **Responsive Testing**: Confirm button centering across all breakpoints
3. **Initial State Testing**: Verify controls are hidden on app load

### Accessibility Testing
1. **Contrast Ratios**: Ensure slider tracks meet WCAG AA standards (4.5:1 minimum)
2. **Focus States**: Verify focus indicators remain visible with new colors
3. **Screen Reader**: Confirm button text changes are announced correctly

### Cross-Browser Testing
1. **Webkit**: Test slider styling in Safari and Chrome
2. **Firefox**: Test slider styling with -moz prefixes
3. **Mobile**: Test touch interactions remain functional

### Implementation Approach
1. **Incremental Changes**: Each fix can be implemented independently
2. **CSS-First**: Prioritize CSS solutions over JavaScript changes
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain existing functionality while fixing bugs

## Design Decisions and Rationales

### Initial State Change
**Decision**: Change `showControls` default from `true` to `false`
**Rationale**: 
- Reduces visual clutter on app load
- Allows users to focus on the breathing visualization first
- Follows progressive disclosure UX principles
- Maintains existing toggle functionality

### Color Contrast Enhancement
**Decision**: Use theme-aware track colors instead of universal white/transparent
**Rationale**:
- Improves accessibility compliance (WCAG AA)
- Provides better visual feedback for user interactions
- Leverages existing CSS custom properties system
- Maintains design consistency with the app's color scheme

### Button Centering Fix
**Decision**: Enhance existing flexbox alignment rather than restructuring layout
**Rationale**:
- Minimal code changes reduce risk of regressions
- Maintains responsive behavior across all screen sizes
- Preserves existing CSS architecture and naming conventions
- Ensures consistency with other centered elements in the app
